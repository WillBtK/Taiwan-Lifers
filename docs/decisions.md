# Decisions log

Append-only. One entry per decision: what was decided, why, what was rejected,
and which files it touches. A later stage should be able to start from this
file plus `STATUS.md` and the README, without re-reading the repo.

## Stage 0 — Scaffold (2026-09-03)

### 0.1 Design spec placed verbatim, then amended only where the spec requires

**Decision.** `docs/artifact_design_system.md` is the user-supplied replication
spec, copied byte-for-byte (47,758 bytes, md5 `79d78825ae54e782f0639c589cf0eb85`).
It was subsequently amended in §5b, §6, §7 and §10 only — to record the palette
validation outcome that §7 itself instructs the first project needing `--gold`
and `--rose` to record.

**Reason.** The README's "unchanged" instruction and the spec's own §7/§10
("record the outcome here", "amend THIS file… rather than patching around it in
page-building code") pull in opposite directions. The spec's instruction is the
more specific one and is the one that prevents the next project repeating the
work, so it wins. README Stage 0 has been reworded to say so.

**Rejected.** Leaving the spec untouched and putting the validation result only
in this log — it would be invisible to the next repo, which copies the spec but
not this file.

**Files.** `docs/artifact_design_system.md`, `README.md`.

### 0.2 Palette: dash encoding is mandatory from four series, not five

**Decision.** Any chart with 4+ series encodes each series by line style as well
as hue. Recorded in spec §5b, §6, §7, §10.

**Reason.** Measured, not judged. `dataviz/scripts/validate_palette.js` against
the spec's own surfaces:

| Set | Mode | Adjacent pairs | All pairs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4-hue | light `#FFFFFF` | pass | **fail** — blue↔purple ΔE 1.0 protan, 9.9 normal |
| 4-hue | dark `#1A1E24` | pass | **fail** — blue↔purple ΔE 5.1 deutan, 11.5 normal |
| 6-hue | light `#FFFFFF` | fail (gold chroma 0.098 < 0.100) | fail — as above |
| 6-hue | dark `#1A1E24` | fail (gold L 0.721 > 0.67 band) | fail — as above |

A normal-vision ΔE below 15 is a hard fail: full-colour readers cannot separate
the pair. Purple is slot 4, so the failing pair is present in every four-series
chart — which is the commonest form in this system. The spec's existing 5-series
threshold was therefore one slot too late.

**Rejected.** (i) Reordering the fixed hue sequence to separate blue and purple
— it would repaint every chart in every project built on the spec, for a problem
that secondary encoding solves; (ii) dropping purple to a three-hue working set
— too restrictive for series 6, which has five categories.

**Files.** `docs/artifact_design_system.md` (§5b, §6, §7, §10).

### 0.3 Gold re-step recommended, not applied

**Decision.** `--gold` fails two checks as specified: chroma 0.098 against a
0.100 floor (light), lightness 0.721 against a 0.48–0.67 band (dark).
Re-stepping to `#8A6A12` (light) and `#B08C38` (dark) returns ALL CHECKS PASS
for the full six-hue set in both modes. Recorded in spec §7; **not** applied to
the §2 tokens.

**Reason.** A token change propagates to every page built from this spec,
including the sibling monitors. That is the user's call, not Stage 0's.

**Rejected.** Silently editing the tokens; or leaving the failure unrecorded.

**Files.** `docs/artifact_design_system.md` (§7) — pending, on approval:
the three `:root` blocks in §2.

### 0.4 Schema `tlfx`, not prefixed tables in `public`

**Decision.** All tables live in schema `tlfx` (README §6), applied to project
`term-premium-atlas` (`xzhoykybwlkefgvgwnii`) as migration
`supabase/migrations/0001_tlfx_schema.sql`. RLS enabled on all 11 tables with no
permissive policy; ingestion uses the service role.

**Reason.** The README specifies schema `tlfx`. The sibling monitors in the same
project (`uk_ldi_*`, `nl_wtp_*`) use prefixed tables in `public`; a separate
schema keeps the fourth monitor from crowding that namespace further. RLS-on
matches every existing table in the project.

**Rejected.** `public.tlfx_*` for consistency with the siblings — consistency
with the README matters more, and the schema boundary makes the Stage 7
cross-market export cleaner.

**Files.** `supabase/migrations/0001_tlfx_schema.sql`.

### 0.5 Two separate basis types, not one

**Decision.** `tlfx.accounting_basis` (`IFRS4`, `IFRS17`) and
`tlfx.measurement_basis` (`disclosed`, `estimated`, `spliced`) are distinct
Postgres enums. `firm_quarterly.basis` is part of the primary key.

**Reason.** README §9 forbids splicing disclosed and estimated CBC series
without a flag, and separately requires both IFRS bases where firms publish
them. These are different failure modes: one is a measurement provenance
question, the other a definitional break in the reporting entity. A single
free-text column invites conflating them at Stage 3, which is exactly where it
would be expensive to unwind.

**Rejected.** One `basis text` column with a check constraint.

**Files.** `supabase/migrations/0001_tlfx_schema.sql`, `src/tlfx/provenance.py`.

### 0.6 `derived_series` carries provenance, not just values

**Decision.** `derived_series` holds `source_url`, `source_doc`, `retrieved_at`,
`vintage`, `basis`, `basis_note` alongside `definition_version`. Natural key
enforced by a unique index on `(series_key, coalesce(entity_id,''), obs_date,
vintage)` — a primary key cannot hold a `coalesce`, and `entity_id` is null for
sector rows.

**Reason.** The spec requires every chart and table in the artifact to carry a
source line naming source and vintage. Stage 6 builds the artifact from
`derived_series` alone; without these columns it would have to re-query upstream
tables to write its captions.

**Rejected.** Deriving source lines at Stage 6 by joining back to source tables —
it breaks the single-blob export and re-introduces a runtime dependency.

**Files.** `supabase/migrations/0001_tlfx_schema.sql`, `README.md` §6.

### 0.7 Net open FX position stored once, presented many ways

**Decision.** Series 2 is stored in NT$ mn. USD, % GDP, % assets and × capital
are separate rows of the same `series_id` under different `unit` values, selected
in the artifact by a `.seg` unit toggle.

**Reason.** The spec bans dual-axis charts outright, so the five units the README
lists cannot be one chart. Storing the presentations as rows keeps the toggle a
pure lookup and keeps each presentation independently traceable.

**Rejected.** Computing presentations client-side in the artifact — it would put
GDP and capital denominators into the page without provenance.

**Files.** `supabase/migrations/0001_tlfx_schema.sql`, `README.md` §3.

### 0.8 User-Agent is per-host, with measured reasons

**Decision.** Default UA is the descriptive `TLFX-monitor/0.1`. Two overrides,
each recorded with the measurement that justifies it, in
`src/tlfx/provenance.py`.

**Reason.** No single string works. Measured 2026-09-03:
`fred.stlouisfed.org` answers `curl/8.5.0`, `python-requests/2.32` and
`Wget/1.21` in under 1.5s but read-times-out (>18s) on both the descriptive
string and a Chrome string — its edge tarpits agents it does not recognise.
Conversely `ir.ctbcholding.com` returns 403 to everything except a browser
string. An initial reading that attributed FRED's behaviour to browser-like
agents was wrong and is corrected in the code comment.

**Rejected.** A single browser UA everywhere (breaks FRED); a single honest UA
everywhere (breaks CTBC).

**Files.** `src/tlfx/provenance.py`, `scripts/check_allowlist.py`.

### 0.9 Allowlist probes retry transport errors but never status codes

**Decision.** `scripts/check_allowlist.py` retries connection resets, closed
tunnels and read timeouts twice with backoff, at 4-way concurrency; HTTP status
codes are never retried. An optional `expect` column marks endpoints that are
reachable but answer non-2xx by design.

**Reason.** At 8-way concurrency the sandbox proxy produced false failures that
did not reproduce — FSC-English and FRED both flipped between runs. A single
attempt cannot distinguish a blocked host from a flaky egress path, and a
Stage-0 report that cries wolf is worse than none. A 403 is an answer, not a
transient fault, so it is recorded as-is. The FRED API returns 400 without a key,
which is proof of reachability, hence `expect`.

**Rejected.** Single-attempt probing (the script's first draft); retrying 5xx and
403 (would mask real source changes).

**Files.** `scripts/check_allowlist.py`, `config/allowlist.tsv`.

### 0.10 Chinese FSC press-list id confirmed as 96

**Decision.** `https://www.fsc.gov.tw/ch/home.jsp?id=96&parentpath=0,2` is the
correct Chinese press-release list; the README's "unconfirmed" note is resolved.
Individual releases sit at
`…&mcustomize=news_view.jsp&dataserno=YYYYMMDDNNNN&dtable=News`.

**Reason.** Fetched 2026-09-03: page title `新聞稿`, carrying insurance items
including `壽險業115年截至6月底外幣保險商品銷售情形` dated 2026-08-25 (the
foreign-currency policy premium release of README §4.1). Dates are ROC calendar
(115年 = 2026).

**Caveat for Stage 1.** id=96 is the *all-FSC* press list, not an insurance-only
feed, and the monthly profit/loss-and-FX release was not on page 1. Stage 1 must
either paginate this list filtering on title, or find the Insurance Bureau's own
release page. Do not assume a fixed page position.

**Files.** `config/allowlist.tsv`, `README.md` §7.
